        The National Institute of Technology, Durgapur (formerly Regional Engineering College, Durgapur), 
    was established by an Act of Parliament in 1960 as one of the eight such colleges aimed to function as a pace setter for
    engineering education in the country and to foster national integration. It is a fully-funded premier Technological Institution
    of the Government of India and is administered by an autonomous Board of Governors. The Institute is a University which awards B.Tech.,
    M.C.A., M.Sc., M.B.A., M.Tech., and Ph.D. degrees to students after their successful completion of the specified courses. 
    The Institute imparts education in the disciplines of Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering,
    Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Metallurgical and Materials Engineering,
    Information Technology, Biotechnology, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Environmental science, Materials Science and Management Studies.
    As decided by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, the procedure for selection of candidates for admission to
    the Bachelor Degree Courses in Engineering/Technology in National Institute of Technology Durgapur and in other NITs is on the basis of 
    State Rank/ All India Rank (AIR) of AIEEE conducted by Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi, and the same is executed through
    counselling by Central Counselling Board, AIEEE under guidance from MHRD, GOI as per schedule notified by CCB. In addition 
    to the normal intake, a few seats are reserved for Foreign Students who are nominated by the Ministry of External Affairs, 
    Government of India, and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, Government of India.

        	At present more than Eight hundred colleges provide engineering education in India. Approximately three hundred of 
        	them offer undergraduate programs in Electrical and Electronic Engineering that include High Voltage Engineering. 
        	It is mandatory as per the guidelines of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) that the laboratory
        	facilities are to be provided for the programs which are offered by the colleges. However, very few colleges have high 
        	voltage and High-Power Laboratory facilities due to the involvement of huge costs and availability of specialised faculty 
        	members as well as skilled staffs in the field of High voltage and High-Power Engineering.

        It specialises in the measurement and testing of equipment and components of Electric Power Engineering. 
        Teaching in laboratories includes studying the breakdown of air under varying atmospheric conditions, especially 
        moisture, varying supply voltage and under multiple insulation arrangements. They are particularly geared towards
        the use of live-line techniques for transmission and distribution system maintenance. Transformer insulation condition measurement 
        is also a set laboratory exercise. Lectures in High Voltage are embodied into specific courses associated with Electric Power 
        Engineering. NIT, Durgapur is having the above facilities towards the High Voltage testing, it will also meet the innovative
        course work, curriculum, research of the students and the testing needs of nearby utilities and industries providing the 
        application of ICT, remote operation facilities.
